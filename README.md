# Yet Another Personal Language interpreter


This is an interpreter that I made outside of my compilers class (translation of programming languages, CSE260)
at Michigan State University. This uses RPLY's lexer generator and RPLY's pushdown automata for parsing.

This interpreter supports scoping, data type enforcement, functions and recursion, inputs, and outputs, as well
as probably some stuff I am not listing here.

This was a lot of fun to make. Enjoy :)
